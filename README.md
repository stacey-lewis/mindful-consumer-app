# README

Mindful consumer website created with Ruby on Rails, accessible here: https://mindful-consumer.herokuapp.com/.
It is built using 4 models: vendors, general public users, categories and values. Many-to-many relationships exist between vendors/users and categories/values.

About the concept:
Mindful consumer site is designed to connect consumers and businesses with like-minded values and products that centre around sustainability outcomes.

The site functionality allows:
* general public users to create an account and nominate areas of interest.
* search for businesses that have specific values or categories.
* an overarching admin user has permissions to create new vendors, and edit and delete them.
* Vendors themselves can edit their own profiles.

Planned improvements:
* detailed content and about page
* restrictions around image upload for vendors to maintain integrity of site
* minimum details requirement for creating / editing vendor profile
* include a model that allows vendors to create and tag blog content.
* updated home page that profiles vendors and recent content.
* more detailed search functionality, including ability to search across multiple combined criteria.
* new module that allows users to fullfil a questionnaire that automatically profiles their interests and matches them to vendors / content
* key word search for vendors / content
* map search functionality
* ability for vendors to manage multiple profiles with one limited admin for their brand (i.e. for multiple locations)
* mobile responsive
* details product availability for vendors

Known Bugs:
* none
